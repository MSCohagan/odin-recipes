                Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the official website of the annual Cohagan Cooking Challenge! This challenge will be taking place over the course of <strong>October 2021</strong> (8/1/21-8/31/21). Participants are welcome to come from anywhere, however the challenge will be held in Ajkl, Cerra. We have rented out a space in the Ajkl Performing Arts center for daily taste testing. Your dish will be ranked on a scale of 1-10. This score will be secret until the end of the month when all scores will be revealed to the general public. The best 3 dishes will be awarded with cash prizes amounting to 5,000 gobbledygooks, 1,000 gobbledygooks, and 500 gobbledygooks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Cash prizes will be presented to winners in person. If you are not present at the award ceremony on <strong>November 5th, 2021</strong> your prize will be given to the next highest scoring contestant. If extenuating circumstances barre you from attending (sickness, plague, the end of the world, etc.) please submit an email to cookingchallenge@fake.com. As always, we appreciate each and every one of our contestants. We hope to ensure your safety and joy by providing the following rules to all contestants, taste testers, and observers:
