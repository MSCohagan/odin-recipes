Hello! This is a project for the Odin Project Introduction course. I'm using the Odin Project in conjunction with FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/JS and hopefully some more full stack down the road. This project is a simple recipies website. As I already know some HTML and CSS I have decided to try and style this project a bit. Feel free to reference this material if you are working on the same project or a similar project but PLEASE do not copy my code.
